This is a data science project exploring the Framingham Heart data, sourced from Kaggle -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset/code

After cleaning and exploring the data, I will machine learning models to identify the most important factors from the data set that determine an individual's risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

CHD is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the UK. Given its significant impact on public health, deciphering the pivotal factors that dictate an individual's susceptibility to CHD is of utmost importance. This understanding serves as a cornerstone for crafting effective awareness campaigns and targeted interventions that have the potential to profoundly influence an individual's health outcomes. This data set includes:
-sex
-age
-education
-smoking status + number of cigarettes smoked per day
-whether they are on blood pressure medication
-stroke
-hypertension
-diabetes
-total cholesterol
-systolic and diastolic blood pressure
-heart rate
-glucose levels (HbA1c)
-whether an individual developed CHD

I am particularly interested in understanding the impact of different factors dependent on sex.
